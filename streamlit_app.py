Hello there! 👋 My name is Idris Ahamed. I'm 9 years old and I study at Lincoln Elementary School in Newark, California. 
Let me tell you a little about myself. 

I love typing! 🖥️ It's so much fun to see how fast I can type and how many words I can type in a minute. 
When I'm not typing, I enjoy playing games, hanging out with my friends, and exploring new things.

My favorite subjects in school are Math and Science because I love solving problems and learning how things work. 
I also enjoy reading books, especially adventure stories. 📚

On weekends, I like to go to the park with my family, ride my bike, and sometimes we even have a picnic! 🧺

I'm always curious and love learning new things. I think that when I grow up, I might want to be a software developer, 
so I can create amazing games and apps that everyone can enjoy!

Thanks for visiting my website! Scroll down to learn more about my hobbies, interests, and some cool stuff I've been up to!

Typing is so much fun! I can spend hours just practicing my typing skills. 
Here are some reasons why I love typing:

1. **It's like a race:** Every time I type, I try to beat my previous speed. I love challenging myself to type faster and more accurately.
2. **It's creative:** I can write stories, poems, and even codes! Typing allows me to put my imagination into words.
3. **It's useful:** Typing helps me with my schoolwork and allows me to communicate with friends and family online.

I have some favorite typing games that I play to improve my speed. Some of them are TypingClub, NitroType, and Dance Mat Typing.

I go to Lincoln Elementary School, which is a really cool place to learn. 
Our teachers are super nice, and I have a lot of friends there. 

Here are some of my favorite things about school:

- **Math Class:** I love solving puzzles and learning new math tricks.
- **Science Experiments:** We do a lot of hands-on experiments in science class. Last week, we made a volcano explode using baking soda and vinegar!
- **Recess:** Recess is the best time of the day because I get to play with my friends. We usually play soccer, tag, or just run around having fun.

I also enjoy art class because I can get creative with colors and shapes. Sometimes, we even get to make things out of clay!
